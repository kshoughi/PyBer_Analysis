# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to summarize ride-sharing data by different city types: urban, suburban and rural. Additionally, multiple-line graph is created to show the total weekly fares for each city type and business recommendation is given for addressing any disparities among the city types.
## Results
It can be seen that total fare for Urban City Types is largest among different city types, while total fare for Rural city type is smallest from January- April 2019.

Additionally, the number of drivers in Urban city type is much larger than rural and suburban city types. From `pyber_summary_df` it can be seen that the number of drivers for Urban area is about 30 times higher than rural areas. In addition, total rides for urban area is 13 times more than rural areas and 2.6 times higher than suburban areas. 

In contrast, Average Fare per Ride is highest in Rural area, $34.62. In Urban city type, this number drops to $24.53. Similarly, Average Fare per Driver for Rural area is $55.49 while the fare per driver for suburban and urban areas are $39.5 and $16.57, respectively. 


## Summary
Based on the graphs and tables created in this project, the following recommendations are given to CEO:  
    
1- The CEO should encourage people in urban areas to use PyBer more. This way more people would use PyBer and the company as well as drivers would make more profit.  

2- The CEO can encourage drivers in Urban city types to move to rural areas or suburban areas. This way, more drivers would be available in rural areas and the drivers would probably make more money since Average Fare per Driver is about 3 times higher in rural areas.  
  
3- Based on the results, it can be seen that there are many drivers in Urban areas, while Average Fare for Driver is smallest in this city type. CEO can cut the number of drivers or make it harder for new drivers to join the drivers. This way, the total number of drivers would decrease and Average Fare per Driver would increase. Therefore, the drivers would make more money.
